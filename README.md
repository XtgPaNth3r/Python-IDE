# Python-IDE
This is a basic IDE made for python only
To use it run the python ide.py file and in the text box write your python code. Press file>compile to save it(I know there is no compiling in python, i didn't know what else to call it). Press file>run module to run your code.
If you want to reset it go to file>new file and it will be blank again.
:) Happy Coding!
